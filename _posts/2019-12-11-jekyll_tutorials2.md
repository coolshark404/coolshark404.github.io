Sorry, I haven't updated my blog for a long time. Many netizens didn't answer the questions in time. I will continue to maintain my blog in the future. If you have any questions, just ask them directly. I will answer them as soon as possible. I hope you can support me a lot.

Before that, I wrote an article [Jekyll to built own blog again](https://jasonsorria.github.io/2016/10/jekyll_tutorials1/). Please read this basic integration first. This article mainly talks about how to use and modify my blog theme. The content of the article includes the following points:

* Modify basic blog information
* Publish articles
* Modify blog style

The basic structure of the blog template root directory is:

```
.
├── _config.yml
├── _includes
├── _layouts
├── _posts
├── _site
├── 404.html
├── about.md
├── archive.html
├── CNAME
├── css
├── feed.xml
├── Gemfile
├── Gemfile.lock
├── images
├── index.html
├── js
├── Rakefile
├── README.md
└── tags.html

```
