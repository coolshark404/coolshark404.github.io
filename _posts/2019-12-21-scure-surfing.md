### 1. You should have a abroad server, i recommend [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).

The reasons why i recommand this platform are that it will give you one year and $300 to use its server for free only need a Visa Card. i believe your all partners who may exist a person has Visa Card. unfortunately, i only recommand [Vultr](http://bwg.yiqimaila.com/vt/).

**1): Configure your VPS:**

- **Creat a new one.**

- **Recommand Los Angeles, memory > 1G, CentOS 7.**

    `$ sudo -i` 

    `$ passwd`

    `vim /etc/ssh/sshd_conf` set allow root to login to yes  

    `$ systemctl start firewall.service` 

    `$ firewall-cmd --zone=public --parmanent --add-port=443/tcp`

    `$ systemctl restart firewall.service`

**3): If you still follow me to there, you will get a JSON file that is V2ray needs, a KEY file and a PEM file.**

### 7. Test with V2ray on Window10 and Linux.   

**1): Entrance your IPS server and configure it again.**

`su root`

- **Startup BBR.**

```shell
echo "net.core.default_qdisc=fq" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control
lsmod | grep bbr
```
- **Install V2ray.**

`bash <(curl -L -s https://install.direct/go.sh)` 

- **Create directory.**

`mkdir /etc/your-domain` such as /etc/xxoo.com

- **Copy json file to `/etc/v2ray` and copy KEY file and PEM file to `/etc/your-domain/`.**

- **Startup V2ray.**

`systemctl restart v2ray.service` 

**2): Install V2ray under Window10.**

- **Download [V2ray-windows-64.zip](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/releases) and [V2rayN.zip](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN/releases).**

- **Unzip the V2rayN.zip and you will get V2rayN.exe which you should put it to the directory of V2ray-windows-64.**

- **Startup your V2rayG and configure it, this domain is your pretend address for which i recommand you add a vedio address because your VPS should run always.**

**3): Install V2ray under Linux.(you can see this article to view more details how to configure it)**

- **test speed**

```shell
$ wgetÂ https://raw.github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py
$ chmod a+rx speedtest.py
$ mv speedtest.py /usr/local/bin/speedtest
$ chown root:root /usr/local/bin/speedtest
$ speedtest
```
